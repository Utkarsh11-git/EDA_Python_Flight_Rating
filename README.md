## EDA Of Flight Ratings Using Python 

The project aims to analyze customer satisfaction in the airline industry by leveraging a dataset containing various attributes related to passengers' experiences. This analysis will provide insights into factors that influence passenger satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and help airlines make data-driven decisions to enhance customer service.

### Dataset Description
* **id** : Unique identifier for each passenger.
* **Gender** : Passenger's gender.
* **Customer Type** : Indicates if the passenger is a loyal or disloyal customer.
* **Age** : Passenger's age.

* **Class** : Travel class (e.g., Business, Economy).
* **Flight Distance** : The distance of the flight in miles.
* **Various Service Ratings** : Ratings for in-flight services like inflight wifi, departure/arrival time convenience, online booking, etc.
* **Departure Delay in Minutes** : Delay in departure time (in minutes).
* **Arrival Delay in Minutes** : Delay in arrival time (in minutes).
* **Satisfaction** : Indicates passenger satisfaction with the overall experience (e.g., "satisfied" or "neutral").

### Objective
* **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, missing values, and basic statistics.
* **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
* **Descriptive Analysis**: Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
* **Visualizations**: Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histogram) to present findings effectively.

### Tools and Libraries
* **Python** programming language.
* Libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for data manipulation and visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebook** in Visual Studio for documentation and analysis.

### Conclusion

This data analytics project will provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction in the airline industry, helping airlines make informed decisions to enhance the passenger experience and improve overall satisfaction.
